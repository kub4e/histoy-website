                After the surrender of Nazi Germany, the shaky alliance between the UK, US and USSR began to crumble. 
                The USSR had installed communist-leaning governments in Eastern European countries that the Soviet Union had 
                liberated from Nazi control during the war. The British and Americans feared the potential spread of Communism deeper into Western Europe 
                and potentially worldwide. As a result, NATO was formed, to which the Soviet Union responded with its own rival alliance, 
                called the Warsaw Pact, setting off the Cold War.

                During the reign of Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union saw itself transformed from an agrarian society to an industrial and military superpower. 
                The cost of that transformation came in the form of millions of Russian citizens dead. Stalin ruled through terror and ensured his rule 
                was unquestioned through continual purges of opposition. The biggest one came to be known as the Great Purge and took place between 1936 and 1938, 
                during which period approximately 600,000 Soviet citizens were executed, and millions were deported or imprisoned in forced labor camps.

                After Stalin’s Death in 1953, came Nikita Khrushchev. His dictatorial rule saw the tensest years of the Cold War. 
                He instigated the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 by installing nuclear weapons just 90 miles from Florida’s coast. 
                Khrushchev was also responsible for a series of political reforms that made Soviet society less repressive. 
                His period came to be known as de-Stalinization. He took steps to improve living conditions, freed many political prisoners, 
                loosened censorship, and closed the Gulag labor camps. His rule came to an end with the deteriorating relations between the Soviet Union 
                and China as well as food shortages across the country, both of which eventually lead to members of his political party 
                to lose hope in his leadership and remove him from office.

                In 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev came to power. He inherited a crumbling Soviet Union, which he hoped to change through reform. 
                He had two political policies that he wished to deploy – glasnost and perestroika. His glasnost plan called for political openness. 
                It addressed the personal restrictions on Soviet people as well as eliminated the remaining traces of Stalinist repression, 
                such as banning of books and the secret police, the latter of which wouldn’t fully dissolve until the USSR’s collapse in 1991.  
                Newspapers could now criticize the government and rivaling political parties could participate in elections. 
                Gorbachev’s reforms were slow to bear fruit and did more to hasten the collapse of the Soviet Union than to help it. 
                Independence movements started to emerge in Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe. The quick collapse lead to an unsuccessful coup 
                by Communist Party hard-liners in August of 1991 which diminished Gorbachev’s power and propelled democratic forces, 
                led by Boris Yeltsin to the forefront of Russian politics. On December 25, Gorbachev resigned and the Soviet Union ceased to exist on December 31, 1991.
