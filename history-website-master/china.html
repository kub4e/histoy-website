                Within the brewing conflict between the two world super powers, China served a surprisingly important role, 
                simply because of its enormous size. Its large population and third largest territory in the world, 
                China was a factor to be taken into account by both sides of the conflict.

                Its strategic alliance with the Soviet Union during the early stages of the Cold War left the United States feeling immediately threatened. 
                The possibility of the combined forces of the two communist states launching offensives is what kickstarted the US’s most extensive 
                peacetime mobilization of national resources in American history. In keeping with its policy of “containment”, the US became involved 
                in the Korean and Vietnam wars in an effort to roll back the communist threat.

                In the late 60’s and early 70’s the situation changed, with the so-called Sino-Soviet split. China’s alliance with the USSR had previously 
                shifted the focus of the Cold War from Europe to East Asia, making the region the main battlefield and helping in keeping the Cold War “cold”. 
                The conflicts in East Asia turned the battlefield into a “buffer” between the US and Soviet Union with China and East Asia in the middle. 
                It ensured that the two superpowers weren’t likely to become involved in a direct military confrontation. 
                China’s crucial role in the conflict was further shown by the Sino-Soviet split. 
                The split was not caused by conflicts in national interests but rather by different understandings and interpretations of the same ideology. 
                After Stalin’s death, Mao increasingly perceived the Chinese Communist Party and himself as qualified to claim leadership in the “World Revolution”. 
                That eventually lead to each Communist state to brand the other as a “traitor” to their true Communism. 
                Following the souring relations between China and the USSR, America was put in a more favorable position in the conflict. 
                Having to now confront both the West and China simultaneously was a major factor in the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 80’s and early 90’s.

                The enormity of the role of the relationship between China and the USSR were paramount in shaping the events of the Cold War. 
                It can’t be argued that China’s role was in any way bigger than either the Soviet Union or the United States nor does it change the bipolar nature of the conflict, 
                but it’s role as the only major country that stood at the intersection of the two superpower camps shouldn’t be underestimated.
